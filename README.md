# My-Vs-configs

#### Hi guys, I am using wsl-2 on my window 11 machine.  I use ubuntu 20.4.4 release and it is my primary terminal for Vs as well. I like installing new extenstions and stuff on my Vs code. I have also made some person coustomizations on my own by reading the documantation.
### I use ubuntu for all the langaugaes i code in  . The languages I use are : python , c ,c++, java, R, nodejs etc .
### So here are some screenshots of my Vs , along with the json file for it.

### Ps: The theme has a green and grey theme
